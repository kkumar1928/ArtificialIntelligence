# From Rachel
- Good presentation
- Used the available scope to do a video presentation
- Would have been nice to have everyone tralking
- Great presentation, talked about many of the key areas needed to cover
- Could have fit more into the presentation to make it 10 minutes long → balancing information given the time available
- Spoke clearly, helped with the descriptions and helped to keep audience engaged

- A little rambling, could possibly have benefited from picking an AI / algorithm and used it as reference for the points.
- Linear and Coherent, intro into main definitions and then addressing the problems etc
- Pre-recorded video
- Density of information
- Coherent speech and Presentation flow, makes for interesting presentation due to the allowance of elaboration in certain cases due to them not over-saturating their slides with information
- Didn’t overcomplicate the detail on the slides – so kept he interest of the listener
- Video could’ve been cleaned up a little to fix some of the errors.
- It is a GROUP presentation, not a KYLE presentation, everyone should Ideally contribute both in research AND in the presentation as by Kyle presenting everything it makes it look like he did everything himself since he was very fluent in elaborating on key points.
- Good
- Solid knowledge base from all parts of the presentation.
- Very good presentation overall – pre recorded video
