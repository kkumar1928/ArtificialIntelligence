Game Selected -> **Poker**

==============How has AI been used to play this game? **Kyle**==============
PokerSnowie and Claudico are AIs that have been created and developed by allowing the computer to determine the best possible strategy by letting them play itself many many times. This allows the AI to learn the best strategy possible. 

Many AIs took the approach of neural networks over making the AI play like a human, this is because Poker does not have one simple strategy, instead it relies on factors such as randomness, chance and luck.

The neural network approach results in odd bet sizing and a much different strategy than humans are used to seeing.

==============What environment does this game exist in? **Kyle**==============
Poker is a competitive game. It is not a game in which it simply takes good "strategy" in order to win such as games like chess. Instead, Poker revolves mainly around deception and mind games. Making the other plays think you have a good hand, when you may not. This is very hard to replicate when it comes to developing AI to play Poker.

==============(Stochastic/deterministic/observable?) + details and explanation as to why **Morgan**===============
Poker is a stochastic game:

-- There are no known algorithms that can be used to predict the outcome of the game.

-- This is because there is a certain amount of randomness as to which card will be drawn.

-- In a perfect scenario the agent will be unable to predict which card will be drawn - this is because they can only see, 
   at a maximum, six cards (in a standard game of texas hold'em, the agent has two cards, and four cards would be visible 
   on the table before the fifth and final card is revealed, and which point randomness is not a factor).

==============Define the problem (state, actions, transition model etc) **Morgan**==============
Using PEAS:

-Performance Measure
-- Another player/agent folding their hand
-- Winning a hand
-- Having more chips than other players/agents
-- Winning the game

-Environment
-- Stochastic
-- Partially observable - we cannot see what cards the other players/agents have and which cards will be drawn
-- Static - the cards that will be drawn and that other players have will not change

-Actuator
-- The only actuators that can be performed are the moves available to a player within poker:
--- Fold
--- Call
--- Check
--- Raise

-Sensors
-- Cards on the table
-- Cards within hand
-- Cards remaining within the deck (based on those on the table)
-- The 'tells' of other players
